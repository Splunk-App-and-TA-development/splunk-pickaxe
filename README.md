Splunk-Pickaxe
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cerner/splunk-pickaxe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/cerner/splunk-pickaxe)

A tool for serializing and syncing your repo of Splunk objects across Splunk instances.

This provides a development workflow for Splunk components (e.g., dashboards,
alerts, reports, etc) and an easy way to apply them consistently.

Check the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to see what has changed.

Getting Started
---------------

Install the gem,

    gem install splunk-pickaxe

Create your repo,

    mkdir my-splunk-repo
    cd my-splunk-repo
    pickaxe init

Update the `.pickaxe.yml` file with your app name from Splunk. This should
be the name from the URL when you visit your Splunk app. (i.e. if your url is
`https://my-splunk.com/en-US/app/my_splunk_app/search` my app is `my_splunk_app`).

You also need to add your Splunk environment(s). So your `.pickaxe.yml` should
look like this,

```yaml
namespace:
  # The application in which to create the Splunk knowledge objects
  app: MY_SPLUNK_APP

environments:
  ENVIRONMENT_NAME:
    url: SPLUNK_API_URL (i.e. https://search-head.my-splunk.com:8089)
```

Add some Splunk objects; see [example repo](example-repo) or below for manually
defining Splunk objects. Alternatively, to retrieve _all_ Splunk objects from
an environment, run:

    pickaxe save ENVIRONMENT_NAME

Where `ENVIRONMENT_NAME` is the name of one of the environments configured in
your `.pickaxe.yml`. These map to different Splunk instances.

You may then modify any of these objects. Afterwards, sync your repo with Splunk:

    pickaxe sync ENVIRONMENT_NAME

By default these commands assume the user has a Splunk account and access to make these
changes in the configured Splunk application. Your password will be requested when run.
Alternatively you can make use of the options `--user` and `--password`.

Splunk Objects
--------------

Currently the following objects are supported,

 * [alerts](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTsearch#saved.2Fsearches)
 * [dashboards](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTknowledge#data.2Fui.2Fviews.2F.7Bname.7D)
 * [eventtypes](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTknowledge#saved.2Feventtypes)
 * [macros](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.1.2/Knowledge/Usesearchmacros)
 * [reports](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTsearch#saved.2Fsearches)
 * [tags](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTknowledge#search.2Ftags.2F.7Btag_name.7D)
 * [field_extractions](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTknowledge#data.2Fprops.2Fextractions)

### Alerts

To add a new alert to the repo simply create a new `ALERT.yml` file under `alerts`.
This YAML file should contain the following at minimum,

```yaml
name: ALERT NAME
config:
  # Search query of events used to trigger alert
  search: >
    MY SEARCH
```

It will be populated with the alert defaults which includes,

 * Running hourly
 * Emailing everyone listed in your `.pickaxe.yml`
 * Alerting if the search results in any events

You can override these defaults or any other property by specifying the property
under the `config` section. [This doc](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTsearch#saved.2Fsearches.2F.7Bname.7D)
contains all the properties for an alert.

By default the alert name will have the splunk environment name appended
to it to differentiate its alert from others. This can be disabled in the
alert's config by setting `pickaxe.environment.in.name` to `false`.

#### Common Overrides

 * To tweak the schedule set `cron_schedule` in the `config` section. By default its setup to run every hour. This should be a cron value (i.e. `0 10 * * 1` or run every Monday at 10am)
 * To tweak the length of the search or how far back the set `dispatch.earliest_time` in the `config` section. By default this is setup to search over the last hour. You could change this to `-7d@h` to search the last 7 days

### Dashboards

To add a new dashboard create a new `DASHBOARD.xml` file under `dashboards`.
The name of the file should be the name of the dashboard. If the file is
`my_dashboard.xml`, this means the name is `my_dashboard`.

The file should contain the XML source of your dashboard. You can get this
by selecting your dashboard in Splunk, then Edit -> Edit Source. Copy the XML
and paste it into the file.

### Eventtypes

To add a new eventtype create a new `eventtype.yml` file under `eventtypes`.
The name of the file should be the name of the eventtype. If the file is
`my_eventtype.yml`, this means the name is `my_eventtype`.

```yaml
name: EVENTTYPE NAME
config:
  disabled: <1|0> Set to 1 to disable
  search: index=my_index more search things
  priority: <1-10> 1 is highest priority and 10 is lowest
  tags: <string> Enter a comma-separated list of tags
  ...
```

### Macros

To add a new macro create a new `macro.yml` file under `macros`.
The name of the file should be the name of the macro. If the file is
`my_macro.yml`, this means the name is `my_macro`.

```yaml
name: MACRO_NAME
config:
  definition: index=my_index search things
```

### Reports

To add a new report to the repo simply create a new `REPORT.yml` file under `reports`.
This YAML file should contain the following at minimum,

```yaml
name: REPORT NAME
config:
  # Search query of events in the report
  search: >
    MY SEARCH
```

It will be populated with the alert defaults which includes,

 * Running hourly
 * Emailing everyone listed in your `.pickaxe.yml`

You can override these defaults or any other property by specifying the property
under the `config` section. [This doc](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTsearch#saved.2Fsearches.2F.7Bname.7D)
contains all the properties for an report.

By default the report name will have the splunk environment name appended
to it to differentiate its report from others. This can be disabled in the
report's config by setting `pickaxe.environment.in.name` to `false`.

#### Common Overrides

 * To tweak the schedule set `cron_schedule` in the `config` section. By default its setup to run every hour. This should be a cron value (i.e. `0 10 * * 1` or run every Monday at 10am)
 * To tweak the length of the search or how far back the set `dispatch.earliest_time` in the `config` section. By default this is setup to search over the last hour. You could change this to `-7d@h` to search the last 7 days

### Tags

To add a new tag to the repo simply create a new `TAG.yml` file under `tags`.
This YAML file should contain the following at minimum,

```yaml
name: TAG
fields:
  - source::/some/file
  - sourcetype::my_type
  ...
```

The important config here is the `fields` key which contains the array of fields
you want in your tag. The value should be of the form `FIELD::VALUE` where `FIELD`
can be things like `source`, `sourcetype`, `eventtype` or any other Splunk field.

### Field Extractions

To add a new field extraction to the repo simply create a new `field_extraction.yml`
file under `field_extractions`. This YAML file should contain the following,

```yaml
name: my field extraction
config:
  # The props.conf stanza to which this field extraction applies, e.g. the
  # sourcetype or source that triggers this field extraction
  stanza: See Comment Above
  # If using EXTRACT type this is the regular expression
  # If using REPORT type specify a comma- or space-delimited list of transforms.conf
  # stanza names that define the field transformations to apply.
  value: See Comment Above
  # Use EXTRACT for inline regular expressions. Use REPORT for a transforms.conf stanza
  type: EXTRACT (or) REPORT
```

### Generic Configuration

Most Splunk objects offer the following additional configuration,

 * `envs`: The list of environments the object should be deployed to

```yaml
name: MY_OBJECT_NAME
envs:
  # Only deploy to dev environment
  - dev
```

By default if `envs` is not provided the object will be imported to all
environments.

All Splunk objects are processed through ERB before being loaded to allow for dynamic configuration.  The values from `.pickaxe.yml` provided within the environment configuration appropriate to the executed command will be added to the ERB binding during the rendering process.

.pickaxe.yml
```yaml
namespace:
  # The application in which to create the Splunk knowledge objects
  app: MY_SPLUNK_APP

environments:
  ENVIRONMENT_NAME:
    url: SPLUNK_API_URL (i.e. https://search-head.my-splunk.com:8089)
    index_name: my_index
```

my_alert.yml
```yaml
name: ALERT NAME
config:
  # Search query of events used to trigger alert
  search: >
    MY SEARCH USING <%= index_name %>
```

Environment variables from the OS can also be referenced.

my_alert.yml
```yaml
name: ALERT NAME
config:
  # Search query of events used to trigger alert
  search: >
    MY SEARCH USING <%= ENV['INDEX_NAME'] %>
```

Config
------

The `.pickaxe.yml` file contains the config for your Splunk resources and should
look like this,

```yaml
namespace:
  # The application name to create the splunk dashboards, alerts, reports, tags, etc...
  app: my_splunk_app

environments:
  dev:
    url: https://logs-api.dev.my-splunk.com
  staging:
    url: https://logs-api.staging.my-splunk.com
  prod:
    url: https://logs-api.prod.my-splunk.com
    # Optional and will default to the root emails config
    emails:
      - my.email@domain.com

# Used for any environments that don't specify emails config
emails:
  - my.email@domain.com
```


### Backwards Compatibility

In previous version the config used to look like this,

```yaml
namespace:
  app: my_splunk_app

environments:
  dev: https://logs-api.dev.my-splunk.com
  staging: https://logs-api.staging.my-splunk.com
  prod: https://logs-api.prod.my-splunk.com

emails:
  - my.email@domain.com
```

Specifically the value for each environment was a String that was the URL for
the Splunk API. The new config format has the environment value as a Hash like
this,

```yaml
namespace:
  app: my_splunk_app

environments:
  dev:
    url: https://logs-api.dev.my-splunk.com
  staging:
    url: https://logs-api.staging.my-splunk.com
  prod:
    url: https://logs-api.prod.my-splunk.com

emails:
  - my.email@domain.com
```

The previous format is still supported but deprecated and will be removed in the
future.
